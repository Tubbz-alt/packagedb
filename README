The `PackageDB` keeps track of package ownership within Fedora.

-------
Project
-------

The `PackageDB` was started in January of 2007 to remove some of the hurdles
that made it more time consuming to maintain packages in Fedora after CVS
acls were introduced.  The intial goal was to take information about who owned,
comaintained, and was allowed to commit changes to a package and put it in a
database where owners could edit it.

The system began to be used by cvsadmins in July of 2007, and was opened for
general use in September.  At present it allows general users to manage the
ownership of packages and allows admins to add new packages or change things
when the owner is unresponsive.  A webUI is open for everyone and a simplistic
commandline client works for admin requests.

Future goals
============

We're trying to manage our Roadmap_ of new features in trac.  So far it's
working out well.  If you have a new feature request, please open a
`trac ticket`_ and we'll add it to the schedule to be worked on.

Installation
------------

Although it's not working yet, the goal is to be able to run::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install --root ${path to installation}

and have a working installation.

--------
Starting
--------

This is a TurboGears (http://www.turbogears.org) project. It can be
started by running the start-pkgdb.py script.  By default it uses the values
in pkgdb/config/app.cfg and dev.cfg to configure itself.  You can specify a
config file instead of dev.cfg on the command line.
