The `PackageDB` keeps track of package ownership within Fedora.

-------
Project
-------

The `PackageDB` was started in January of 2007 to remove some of the hurdles
that made it more time consuming to maintain packages in Fedora after CVS
acls were introduced.  The intial goal was to take information about who owned,
comaintained, and was allowed to commit changes to a package and put it in a
database where owners could edit it.

The system began to be used by cvsadmins in July of 2007, and was opened for
general use in September.  At present it allows general users to manage the
ownership of packages and allows admins to add new packages or change things
when the owner is unresponsive.  A webUI is open for everyone and a simplistic
commandline client works for admin requests.

Future goals
============

We're trying to manage our Roadmap_ of new features in trac.  So far it's
working out well.  If you have a new feature request, please open a
`trac ticket`_ and we'll add it to the schedule to be worked on.

Installation
------------

Although it's not working yet, the goal is to be able to run::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install --root ${path to installation}

and have a working installation.

Running from a Checkout
=======================

If you want to run from a checkout, you can perform the following commands::

Install Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::
  yum -y install python-genshi TurboGears python-turbojson postgresql-server \
    python-TurboMail python-bugzilla python-fedora python-psycopg2 \
    python-sqlalchemy python-feedparser

Get and Build the Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::
  bzr branch bzr://bzr.fedorahosted.org/bzr/packagedb/fedora-packagedb-devel
  cd fedora-packagedb-devel
  python setup.py egg_info
  python setup.py build --install-conf=`pwd` --install-data=`pwd`

Setup the Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure there's a line in your /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf that says::

  host	all	all	127.0.0.1/32	md5

It might look like this now::

  host	all 	all	127.0.0.1/32	ident sameuser

Create the postgres user that you'll set in the config file::

  sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
  sudo -u postgres createuser -P -E pkgdbadmin

Get some tet data and import it into the database::
  wget https://fedorahosted.org/releases/p/a/packagedb/pkgdb-20080422.dump.bz2
  bzcat pkgdb-20080422.dump.bz2 | sudo -u postgres psql

Start the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First you need to configure the server to see your database.  You'll need to
set fas.username to a username (your Fedora Account System username will work),
fas.password (if you use your username, your password will work), and
sqlalchemy.dburi.  The dburi line will be something like this::

  sqlalchemy.dburi="postgres://pkgdbadmin:testpassword@localhost/pkgdb"

Then start the server::

  python start-pkgdb
