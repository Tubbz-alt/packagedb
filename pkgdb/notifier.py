    # us to an event via a notify() method.  The notify() method needs to know
    # - Who made the change
    # - What change is made
    # - What the change was made to.
    # - Using that information, it can construct an event that it deals with.
    # Processing could include:
    # - Log change to a database
    # - Send event to a notification server
    # - Update queues with changes that need to be made to other systems.
