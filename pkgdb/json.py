JSON Helper functions.  Most JSON code  directlry related to functions is
implemented via the __json__() methods in model.py

# A JSON-based API(view) for your app.
# Most rules would look like:
# @jsonify.when("isinstance(obj, YourClass)")
# def jsonify_yourclass(obj):
#     return [obj.val1, obj.val2]
# @jsonify can convert your objects to following types:
# lists, dicts, numbers and strings

class SABase(object):
    def __json__(self):
        '''Transform any SA mapped class into json.

        This method takes an SA mapped class and turns the "normal" python
        attributes into json.  The properties (from properties in the mapper)
        are also included if they have an entry in jsonProps.  You make
        use of this by setting jsonProps in the controller.

        Example controller::
          john = model.Person.query.filter_by(name='John').one()
          # Person has a property, addresses, linking it to an Address class.
          # Address has a property, phone_nums, linking it to a Phone class.
          john.jsonProps = {'Person': ['addresses'],
                  'Address': ['phone_nums']}
          return dict(person=john)

        jsonProps is a dict that maps class names to lists of properties you
        want to output.  This allows you to selectively pick properties you
        are interested in for one class but not another.  You are responsible
        for avoiding loops.  ie: *don't* do this::
            john.jsonProps = {'Person': ['addresses'], 'Address': ['people']}
