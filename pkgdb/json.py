JSON Helper functions.  Most JSON code  directlry related to functions is
implemented via the __json__() methods in model.py

# A JSON-based API(view) for your app.
# Most rules would look like:
# @jsonify.when("isinstance(obj, YourClass)")
# def jsonify_yourclass(obj):
#     return [obj.val1, obj.val2]
# @jsonify can convert your objects to following types:
# lists, dicts, numbers and strings

    The one special thing is that we bind the special jsonProps into each

    query result and it will pass to all of its children.
