# Mapped Tables
#
# Collection of packages.
# 
# Collections are a set of packages.  They can represent the packages in a
# distro, in a SIG, or on a CD.
#
# Fields:
# :name: "Fedora Core", "Fedora Extras", "Python", "GNOME" or whatever
#   names-for-groupings you want.  If this is for a grouping that a SIG is
#   interested in, the name should make this apparent.  If it is for one
#   of the distributions it should be the name for the Product that will
#   be used in Bugzilla as well.
# :version: The release of the `Collection`.  If the `Collection` doesn't
#   have releases (for instance, SIGs), version should be 0.
# :statuscode: Is the collection being worked on or is it inactive.
# :owner: Creator, QA Contact, or other account that is in charge of the
#   collection.  This is a foreign key to an account id number.  (Since the
#   accounts live in a separate db we can't have the db enforce validity.)
# :publishURLTemplate: URL to packages built for this collection with
#   [ARCH] and [PACKAGE] as special symbols that can be substituted from the
#   specific package built.
# :pendingURLTemplate: URL to packages built but not yet in the repository
#   with [ARCH] and [PACKAGE] as special symbols that can be substituted from
#   the specific package built.
# :summary: Brief description of the collection.
# :description: Longer description of the collection.

# Collections and Branches have an inheritance relationship.  ie: Branches are
# just Collections that have additional data.

# :C0103: Tables and mappers are constants but SQLAlchemy/TurboGears convention
# is not to name them with all uppercase
# pylint: disable-msg=C0103

# Associate the packages in one collection with another collection.
#
# This table is used to allow one `Collection` to be based on another with
# certain packages that are overridden or not available in the `base`
# `Collection`.  For instance, a `Collection` may be used to experiment with
# a major version upgrade of python and all the dependent packages that need
# to be rebuilt against it.  In this scenario, the base might be
# "Fedora Core - devel".  The overlay "FC devel python3".  The overlay will
# contain python packages that override what is present in the base.  Any
# package that is not present in the overlay will also be searched for in
# the base collection.
# Once we're ready to commit to using the upgraded set of packages, we want
# to merge them into devel.  To do this, we will actually move the packages
# from the overlay into the base collection.  Probably, at this time, we
# will also mark the overlay as obsolete.
#
# Keeping things consistent is a bit problematic because we have to search for
# for packages in the collection plus all the bases (an overlay can have
# multiple bases) and any bases that they're overlays for.  SQL doesn't do
# recursion -- in and of itself so we have to work around it in one of these
# ways:
# 1) Do the searching for packages in code; either a trigger on the server or
#    in any application code which looks at the database.
# 2) Use a check constraint to only have one level of super/subset.  So if
#    devel contains python-2.5, devel cannot be a subset and python-2.5 cannot
#    be a superset to any other collection.  Have an insert trigger that
#    checks for this.
# 3) Copy the packages.  When we make one collection a subset of another, add
#    all its packages including subset's packages to the superset.  Have an
#    insert trigger on packageList and packageListVer that check whether this
#    collection is a subset and copies the package to other collections.
# Option 1, in application code may be the simplest to implement.  However,
# option 3 has the benefit of running during insert rather than select.  As
# always, doing something within the database rather than application logic
# allows us to keep better control over the information.
#
# * Note: Do not have an ondelete trigger as there may be overlap between the
# packages in the parent and child collection.
#
# Fields:
# :overlay: The `Collection` which overrides packages in the base.
# :base: The `Collection` which provides packages not explicitly listed in
#    `overlay`.
# :priority: When searching for a package within a collection, first check the
#    `overlay`.  If not found check the lowest priority `base` collection and
#    any `base` Collections that belong to it.  Then check the next lowest
#    priority `base` until we find the package or run out. `base`s of the same
#    `overlay` with the same `priority` are searched in an undefined order.
